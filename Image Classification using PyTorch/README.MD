# Image Classification using PyTorch on Food-101 dataset

## Introduction
The Food-101 dataset is a collection of images representing different food items, widely used in the field of computer vision for image classification tasks. In this project, we aim to utilize PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying food items from the Food-101 dataset.

## Goals
1. To implement image classification using deep learning techniques with PyTorch.
2. To gain hands-on experience with PyTorch, a widely used deep learning framework.
3. To achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying food items from the Food-101 dataset.
4. To evaluate the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
- PyTorch: A popular deep learning framework developed by Facebook.
- Food-101 dataset: A dataset of images representing various food items, commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment facilitating the development and documentation of the project.

## Project Steps
1. Data Preparation
    - Load the Food-101 dataset.
    - Preprocess the data (e.g., resizing, normalization, etc.).
    - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. Model Architecture
    - Define the architecture of the CNN model using PyTorch.
    - Choose appropriate activation functions and loss functions.
    - Select an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD, etc.).

3. Model Training
    - Train the model on the training set.
    - Utilize the validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
    - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, etc.) as needed.

4. Model Evaluation
    - Evaluate the trained model on the test set.
    - Calculate relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Visualize the results (e.g., confusion matrix, classification report, etc.).

5. Model Deployment (Optional)
    - Save the trained model for future use.
    - Deploy the model for inference on new data (e.g., using PyTorch's deployment tools).

## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully developed an image classification model using PyTorch on the Food-101 dataset. We achieved a high level of accuracy in classifying food items, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for image classification tasks. Through this project, we gained valuable hands-on experience with PyTorch and deep learning concepts, laying a strong foundation for further exploration and experimentation in this exciting field.
