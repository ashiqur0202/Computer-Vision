# Image Classification with TensorFlow on Food-101 Dataset

## Introduction

In this project, we will implement an image classification model using TensorFlow on the Food-101 dataset. The Food-101 dataset consists of 101,000 images of food items divided into 101 categories. We will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build our image classifier.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
    - Download the Food-101 dataset from its official website or Kaggle.
    - Extract the dataset and organize it into appropriate directories.
    - Preprocess the data, such as resizing images, splitting into training and validation sets, and normalizing pixel values.

2. **Building the CNN Model**
    - Build a CNN model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
    - Use pre-trained models like VGG16 or InceptionV3 as a base and fine-tune for our specific task.
    - Define the architecture of the CNN, including the number of layers, filters, and activation functions.

3. **Training the Model**
    - Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
    - Train the model on the training data and validate on the validation set.
    - Monitor training progress using metrics like accuracy and loss.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the model performance on the test set.
    - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Visualize confusion matrix to understand the model's performance on different classes.

5. **Model Fine-tuning**
    - Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer.
    - Try different architectures or pre-trained models to improve performance.
    - Use techniques like data augmentation to increase the diversity of training data.

6. **Deployment and Inference**
    - Save the trained model for deployment.
    - Develop an inference pipeline to classify images using the trained model.
    - Test the inference pipeline on new images to check its performance.

## Conclusion

This project aims to classify food images into 101 different categories using TensorFlow and convolutional neural networks. Through this project, we will learn about image classification, deep learning, and how to build and train CNNs using TensorFlow.

By following this outline, you can create a step-by-step guide for your image classification project on the Food-101 dataset.
