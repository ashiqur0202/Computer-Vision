# Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects Repository! This repository contains projects related to computer vision, a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. Here, you'll find various projects aimed at solving different computer vision tasks using state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms.

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field focused on enabling computers to gain a high-level understanding of digital images or videos. It involves extracting meaningful information from visual data and encompasses tasks such as image recognition, object detection, image segmentation, and more. Computer vision finds applications in diverse fields, including healthcare, autonomous vehicles, surveillance, augmented reality, and robotics.

## Projects

### 1. Image Classification

**Description:** Image classification is the task of categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. This project aims to develop deep learning models capable of accurately classifying images into different categories. We'll explore various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and techniques for improving classification accuracy.

### 2. Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Footage

**Description:** Anomaly detection in surveillance footage involves identifying abnormal events or behaviors in video streams. This project focuses on developing algorithms to automatically detect anomalies, such as unusual activities or objects, in surveillance videos. We'll investigate techniques like spatiotemporal analysis, anomaly scoring, and unsupervised learning to detect anomalies effectively.

### 3. Visual Tracking

**Description:** Visual tracking is the process of locating and following a moving object in a video sequence over time. This project aims to develop robust visual tracking algorithms capable of tracking objects accurately in challenging conditions, such as occlusions, illumination changes, and background clutter. We'll explore tracking-by-detection approaches, correlation filters, and deep learning-based trackers.

### 4. Facial Recognition Systems

**Description:** Facial recognition systems are used to identify or verify individuals based on their facial features. This project focuses on building facial recognition systems using deep learning techniques. We'll explore face detection, face alignment, feature extraction, and face recognition algorithms to develop accurate and efficient facial recognition systems.
